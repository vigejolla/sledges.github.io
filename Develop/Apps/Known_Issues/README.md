## SDK Known Issues

These are the known issues with the Sailfish SDK. If you have any
questions, feel free to either write it up in
<https://forum.sailfishos.org/> or send an e-mail to developer-care at
jolla.com. We’ll get back to you as soon as possible. Please review also
the [Release notes](/Application_SDK#Release_Notes) for the
SDK release.

### Installer / Uninstaller

  - In Windows 8 the installer tool (SDKMaintenanceTool.exe) should be
    started only from the directory containing Sailfish SDK. Invoking it
    from Control Panel -\> Programs and Features might lead to erroneous
    behavior.
  - If you want to reinstall the SDK to another location it is
    recommended to first remove SDK installation and then manually
    delete the config file directory (in Linux and Mac it’s in
    $HOME/.config/SailfishSDK, in Windows this is not necessary anymore)
    and then reinstall SDK.
  - When uninstalling – SDKMaintenanceTool might show a dialog of some
    certain directories not being empty. This is OK and can be bypassed
    by selecting ‘Ignore’.
  - The installer does not handle all error conditions.
  - Virtual machines and Qt Creator must be shut down for the
    uninstaller to run cleanly.
  - If your /home dir has free space but / (root dir) does not then
    installer will complain. Solution: pre-create the destination
    directory and the installer will continue or if that does not work,
    additionally set the environment value TMPDIR to a path that has
    enough space.
  - If installing Sailfish SDK into /opt doesn’t work then please
    install to /home/$USER/Sailfish OS.
  - On Mac and Windows the automatic check for updates may fail randomly
    due to an error in Qt Installer Framework. It is possible to start
    updater manually from menu Help in Qt Creator.
  - The Installer and SDK Maintenance Tool is not HTTPS-capable on
    Windows

### Qt Creator

  - Qt Creator might show a kit called “Desktop”. It cannot be used to
    create Sailfish OS applications and you should not select it when
    configuring Sailfish OS projects.
  - Qt Creator 3 uses OpenGL rendering for some parts of its user
    interface, which might cause issues with virtualization for example.
  - If building and/or deployment fails with timeout, check the color of
    the icons indicating build engine and emulator state in Qt Creator
    (bottom left icons, red=running, green=not running, gray=starting
    up).
  - When launching applications from the toolbar or using ctrl+R, it is
    possible to launch multiple instances of an application which need
    terminating from the Home screen.
  - Selecting Build / Clean all or Clean Project does not remove the
    Makefile.
  - SDK cannot be installed to a path with whitespace. Projects cannot
    be created to paths with whitespace.
  - Some Windows 8 setups do not have HOME, which is needed by MerSDK.
  - In OS X /tmp directory cannot be used as alternate source directory.
  - The following warnings are produced for build targets older than
    3.3.0.x: Could not resolve the prototype "SilicaItem" of
    "PageHeader". (M301)

### SDK CLI (sfdk)

  - Cannot pipe output to/from commands executed on build engine and
    devices

### Sailfish OS Build Engine

  - Timeout problems connecting to Build Engine
      - Some users may experience random timeouts when deploying
        applications from Qt Creator. This can for example happen in an
        environment where your computer has no Internet connection or
        changes WiFi station during the day. The error condition will
        look similar to what’s below:

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        `... Checking for unpackaged file(s): /usr/lib/rpm/check-files
        /home/deploy/installroot Project ERROR: Could not connect to
        Sailfish OS Build Engine Virtual Machine. Timeout waiting for
        reply from server. 08:49:24: The process
        "/Users/username/.config/SailfishBeta1/mer-sdk-tools/MerSDK/Sailfish OS-i486/deploy"
        exited with code 1. Error while building/deploying project
        foobar (kit: MerSDK-Sailfish OS-i486) When executing step 'Rpm'
        ...`
        It may be possible to fix this condition by adding the name
        SailfishSDK to your computer’s hosts file:
        `127.0.0.1 SailfishSDK`
        Or if you already have a line with 127.0.0.1 there, just add the
        SailfishSDK to the end of the existing line like this:
        `127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost SailfishSDK`

<!-- end list -->

  - Issues with Docker-based build engine
      - Packages built from sources under the alternate source directory
        have all files executable
      - Old sailfish-os-build-engine images keep piling up (see
        [Application\_SDK\_FAQ\#Old\_sailfish-os-build-engine\_images\_keep\_piling\_up,\_is\_this\_desired?](/Develop/Apps/FAQ))
      - Failure to deploy from docker based build engine to emulator
        with customized SSH port
      - Qt Creator needs restart after changing SSH port of a Docker
        based build engine

### Sailfish OS Emulator

  - If the Emulator fails to boot to user interface, the reason might be
    disabled virtualization technology settings in host computer’s BIOS.
    By turning on virtualization technology settings from BIOS, the
    emulator should boot up to user interface.
  - Application icon will not show up in home screen if using ‘Deploy by
    Copying Binaries’ method in Qt Creator, solution is to use RPM
    deployment once.
  - Emulator may display a banner about Charging status when starting
    up. It can be dismissed by clicking on it. Emulator follows the
    battery status of the host computer.
  - Emulator pulley menu sounds are not always played.
  - The Emulator screen is bigger vertically than many laptop screens
    and ‘scaling’ may be needed for some uses. Scaling can be controlled
    from Qt Creator, menu Tools -\> Sailfish OS -\> Emulator Mode.
  - Emulator might start flickering on slow computers.
  - Timeout problems connecting to emulator
  - Application covers near to the left/right screen edge are rendered
    incorrectly when emulator is running in landscape mode - part of the
    cover is darker.
  - Deployment to Sailfish OS 3.4.0.24 emulator fails with error "ssh:
    Could not resolve hostname 10.220.220.a: Name or service not known".
    Workaround is to fix the configuration like with `sed -i
    's/`<index>`a/`<index>`10/'
    Sailfish OS/{,emulator/*/}vmshare/devices.xml` and restart emulator
    every time devices configuration changes.

### Debugging

  - GDB may crash occasionally when stepping into code.
  - On Linux the debugger binary depends on `libtinfo.so.5`. On some
    ditributions this library is not installed by default when symbols
    normally provided by this library are available from
    `libncurses.so.5`. E.g. on Fedora the package `ncurses-compat-libs`
    must be installed manually, on Ubuntu 19.10 it is `libncurses5`. If
    you find no way to fix `libtinfo.so.5` on your system, you can
    create it as a symlink to your system `libncurses.so.5` in
    `~/Sailfish OS/lib/` and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` accordingly prior to
    running `~/Sailfish OS/bin/qtcreator`.

### General / Other

  - Microsoft Hyper-V is incompatible with Virtualbox ([Virtualbox
    ticket 16801](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/16801)). Please,
    check that it's disabled in Windows Features before starting the
    Emulator or the Build Engine. This is a known issue especially with
    Windows 10.
      - Recent Windows and VirtualBox versions are said to remove this
        limitation - please check the [What are the compatibility issues
        with Sailfish OS emulators on
        Windows?](/Develop/Apps/FAQ)
        entry in our Docker related FAQ.
  - If you need to set a proxy to connect to the Internet, connections
    from the Emulator are known to fail. Proxy settings for the Build
    Engine can be configured inside Qt Creator, under Options \>
    Sailfish OS \> Build Engine.
