First of all - thank you\! Contributions to the wiki are very welcome :)

The Sailfish OS wiki should be a reliable and accurate source of
information and it's important that we work together to ensure this.
What this means in practice is that we all need to follow some
guidelines for wiki contributions.

  - **Search:** There's a lot of content on the wiki and in the
    reference areas - make sure the information you want to contribute
    isn't mentioned elsewhere. If it is then strongly consider including
    a suitable link instead (and by 'strongly consider' we're just being
    polite - don't duplicate information\!)
  - **Where:** The Sailfish OS documentation is divided into two areas :
    support/integration content and reference content. The wiki should
    be used for guidance documentation (this is typically conversational
    and gives a high level explanation). Detailed reference information
    and anything more than minimal code snippets usually belongs in or
    near the source code - see the [Reference Documentation
    Contributions](/Reference_Documentation_Contributions)
    page for more about that.
  - **Location:** Wiki's are notoriously hard to keep organised so think
    carefully about where your content belongs - if in doubt talk to one
    of the [Wiki editors](/Wiki_editors). If you think you
    need to change the menu then you **must** talk to the editors
    first\! The [Wiki Navigation](/_) page
    should help.
  - **Consistency:** Below are some links to templates or check pages.
    These are intended both to provide some consistency to similar pages
    and to remind you what kind of content should be included.
  - **Public:** Contributions are public and will be published using the
    wiki's open license. Once information is published it cannot be
    reliably deleted from the internet so please bear that in mind.
    Changes are also stored (and linked to your account) in the Recent
    Changes logs - make sure you're happy with all this.
  - **Style:** The Sailfish OS wiki style is conversational and friendly
    - don't try to make things sound formal and technical, the OS is
    complicated enough as it is\! On the other hand be accurate and use
    the correct technical terms where it makes sense - you're talking to
    other competent engineers, not pointy-haired managers ;)
  - **Legal:** be aware of licenses and copyright. You should only add
    content you create or can attribute under a suitable license

Having said all that:

  - **Add:** Get typing - think about who's reading your work and ensure
    it's appropriate and relevant
  - **Improve:** If you know something is missing, mistyped or
    misleading then please fix it. If you aren't confident then feel
    free to find out on email. irc or something and make sure you've got
    your facts right - this is really important work and as a bonus if
    you say to someone "I checked the docs and still don't quite
    understand - explain it to me and I'll improve the documentation"
    then you're likely to get a lot more help

There are a few areas of the site that should be pretty consistent so
we've added some checklists:
