## Common Development Tasks

As a [contributor](/Develop/Collaborative_Development) to Sailfish OS,
there are a variety of slightly more advanced tasks which you may
occasionally be required to perform. While in many cases the average
contributor will never have to do these, it is useful information for
every contributor and developer of Sailfish OS.

### Creating Packages

In some cases, a contributor will wish to contribute an entirely new
feature, either as a standalone application or a plugin to an existing
application or framework in Sailfish OS. Creating a new package is often
the correct course of action in this instance.

To do so, the contributor must:

1.  request that a new repository be created
2.  commit the code to that repository following the [Collaborative
    Development](/Develop/Collaborative_Development) process
3.  write an RPM .spec package file and commit that to the repository
4.  trigger OBS to build the package
5.  ensure that the package is pulled into an image via the appropriate
    "pattern"

### Creating Images

The [Mer Imager service](https://img.merproject.org/img/) allows
contributors to construct images which contain a specific set of
content. This can be useful for creating SDK target RootFS images, or
for creating device-flashable images.

### Flashing Devices

To flash a device, the contributor should download the flashable image
tarball from the imager service. That tarball will contain a script
(flash.sh for Linux, flash.bat for Windows) which allows the device to
be flashed. The contributor needs to have a recent version of fastboot
which can talk to their specific device.

To flash the device, the contributor should reboot the device into
fastboot mode, then run the flash script on their host machine, and then
plug their (fastboot-mode) device into their host machine via USB. The
flash script should then flash the device successfully.

More information is available at the [Flashing](/Develop/HW_Adaptation/Flashing)
page.

### Diagnostics

A variety of diagnostic information can be retrieved from the device,
including journal logs, telemetry information (including memory and CPU
usage snapshots over time, battery usage reports, and data transfer
reports), crash dumps, and telephony and connectivity information. A
comprehensive list of commands to retrieve diagnostics information is
included in the [Sailfish OS Cheat
Sheet](/Reference/Sailfish_OS_Cheat_Sheet).
