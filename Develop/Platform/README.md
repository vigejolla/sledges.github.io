The Sailfish OS platform core packages are situated on top of the
hardware adaptation in the Sailfish OS
[Architecture](/Reference/Architecture). If you want to add features,
improve existing functionality, address security issues, fix bugs, write
unit tests or improve documentation in the Sailfish OS platform then this
involves developing Sailfish OS core packages related to [Core Areas and
APIs](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs).

At a high level this means interacting with source repositories; using
the [Platform SDK](/Tools/Platform_SDK) to build packages; deploying
and testing packages and merging changes back into the source control
systems.
