## Secrets and Crypto

Sailfish OS offers secure storage and cryptographic operations
functionality to client applications via the Sailfish OS Secrets and
Crypto Framework. This framework includes a system daemon, plugins to
the system daemon which implement the functionality which is offered to
clients (and may be backed by a Secure Peripheral or Trusted Execution
Environment application), and Qt-based client APIs for the Secrets and
Crypto domains.

### API

The secure storage and cryptographic operations stack in Sailfish OS
includes several API components. All of the native API components are
fully open-source.

#### Platform API

Sailfish OS provides the Sailfish::Secrets and Sailfish::Crypto APIs to
clients. The APIs are thin wrappers around DBus calls to the system
daemon, which delegates client requests to plugins which implement the
offered functionalities.

All of the code is open source and can be found in the repository:

  - <https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-secrets>

#### Android Compatibility

No Android Compatibility is currently offered. In the future, this
functionality is intended to be offered via the bridge service.

### Contribution

Community or third-party contributions to the secure storage and
cryptographic operations stack in Sailfish OS is encouraged and
appreciated. The platform API and implementation is fully open source,
and issues can be raised directly in the repository, and its developers
are also available in IRC (\#sailfishos@freenode) and via email.
