As Sailfish OS is intended for use in mobile devices and particularly in
mobile phones it's quite important that there is an effective cellular
telephony stack to enable the user to manage and use contacts and to
make, receive and manage phone calls, messages and data connections over
GSM networks - the essential functionality of a mobile phone.

## Overview

The stack consists of components that provide this functionality as well
as generally interoperating with the cellular network. Some additional
components that extend or enhance the use of cellular telephony are
explained later as are some extension mechanisms which provide a means
to implement additional feature to be found in many modern mobile
phones.

The components are shown in the figure below:

The cellular stack consists of:

  - RIL : Android HAL
  - oFono : modem abstraction
  - Connman : Connection Handling
  - Telepathy : Voice and message middleware
  - MCE/StateFS : Modem state handling
  - Contactsd : Contacts handling
  - Call and message handling

## How and Why is Android involved?

Android currently dominates the mobile industry which leads to the
almost exclusive provision of BSPs for the Android OS. SFOS therefore
must make use of the low level software components (the HAL) intended
for use by Android - it does this using the
[libhybris](/libhybris) compatibility mechanism.

Although the upper levels of the Telephony stack are open the modem and
audio hardware adaptations are almost always proprietary.

The [Android Telephony Hardware Abstraction
Layer](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Telephony/Android_Telephony_Hardware_Abstraction_Layer) (HAL)
contains the hardware specific code including the Radio Interface Layer
(RIL)

## oFono: cellular modem abstraction

The [Cellular Modem Abstraction](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Telephony/Cellular_Modem_Abstraction)
layer hides modem specific features and dependencies from other software
layers. It provides a standard interface and adapts a modem specific
behaviour to that interface. It forms a central element in the telephony
stack and consists of two modules: Libqofono and oFono.

In a modern mobile software platform there are other technologies that
are used together with the cellular telephony. These technologies can
either use the telephony technology to extend their functionality or
they are used to extend the functionality of the telephony technology.
Here are some extensions:

  - [Cellular Positioning](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Telephony/Cellular_Positioning)
  - [Cellular Network Time](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Telephony/Cellular_Network_Time)
  - [Cellular USB Tethering](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Telephony/Cellular_USB_Tethering)

and some users:

  - [Seamless Software Update Cellular
    Usage](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Telephony/Seamless_Software_Update_Cellular_Usage)
  - [Bluetooth Cellular Usage](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Networking/Bluetooth_Cellular_Usage)

## Cellular Data Connections

Cellular networks provide data connection services to allow access to
the Internet. In [Cellular Data
Connections](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Telephony/Cellular_Data_Connections) are handled by five
components. Four main components: ConnMan, Libconnman-qt,
Nemo-qml-plugin-connectivity and ConnectionAgent. There is an additional
Provisioning-service extension component.

## Telepathy Framework

The middleware for a cellular voice call and an SMS is provided by the
[Telepathy Framework](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Telephony/Telepathy_Framework). Its primary
purpose is to abstract the protocol or technology used for a voice call
and messaging by giving a unified interface. From the Telepathy client
perspective, sending a message or making a voice call should be the same
regardless of the protocol or technology used. eg: it should be no
different for a client to make a cellular voice call or a SIP (Session
Initiation Protocol) based IP voice call using Telepathy. This is
achieved by using a modular design where each module communicates with
each other via the D-Bus communication framework.

## Cellular modem state handling

In a mobile software platform it is necessary to handle the changes
indicated by the modem and the state changes of the modem. Whilst this
can be done independently by each application following the state
changes forwarded by the modem adaptation layer (oFono) this can create
unwanted complexity, so other means are provided. [StateFS and
MCE](/Networking#StateFS_and_MCE) provide information about
system states, including the modem and modem related states.

## Contacts handling

There are multiple components which relate to the management of contact
data in Sailfish OS, which together provide access to contact
information from various sources including SIM cards, instant messaging
rosters, synchronisation servers, and social networks. For more
information about the components in the contacts domain, please seee the
documentation [here](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Contacts).

## Cellular voice call and message handling

The upper part of the cellular telephony architecture is cellular voice
calls and message handling. This consists of four components: Voicecall,
Commhistory-daemon, Libcommhistory, and Mms-engine. They interact with
other parts of the system, such as Libqofono and Telepathy to enable the
implementation of applications for receiving and sending messages (SMS
and MMS), as well as receiving and making voice calls using the cellular
network. More information about these components of the telephony stack
can be found [here](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Apps_and_MW/Telephony).
