Sailfish Multimedia uses QtMultimedia, on top of GStreamer 1.0
supporting the 'base', 'good' and 'bad' plugin collections, built
against several open-source codec libraries. The 'ugly' plugin set is
not supported for licensing reasons. Additional software codecs are
supported by [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and available through
GStreamer using the gst-libav plugin.

On libhybris devices, hardware codecs, camera support and hardware video
buffers from the Android HAL are exposed in a custom open source
GStreamer plugin, [gst-droid](https://github.com/sailfishos/gst-droid),
that interacts with a custom Android multimedia service,
[droidmedia](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia).

The GStreamer elements provided can be used through QtMultimedia, but
also directly:

  - **droidcamsrc** - Camera element wrapping the Android Camera API1,
    exposing sink pads for viewfinder, photos and video. Camera
    parameters such as camera device, picture resolution, flash, focus,
    scene mode are exposed through QtMultimedia. A special 'recorder'
    mode allows raw video data to be directly fed into hardware codecs
    in the Android layer, to increase performance.
  - **droidvdec, droidvenc, droidadec, droidaenc** - Wrappers for the
    Android OMX video and audio codecs provided by the base Android
    system layer.
  - **droideglsink** - Hardware EGL video display. Can consume Android
    hardware buffers directly from the camera viewfinder and video
    decoders, and also propose them to other software video decoders.

Media indexing is provided by [GNOME
Tracker](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Tracker/), using its
internalffmpeg for video extraction to avoid interfering with the video
hardware through GStreamer.

Sailfish uses Pulseaudio for sound support.
[Ohm](https://git.sailfishos.org/mer-core/ohm) handles routing and
policy, for example to ensure that media players are paused when a voice
call arrives, or when headphones are unplugged.

## Format support

Multimedia formats currently supported by Sailfish. Hardware accelerated
codecs are device and license specific, and so may not be present for
all devices.
