[Qt](http://www.qt.io/developers/) is a powerful cross-platform
application library which is ideal for connected devices. In Sailfish OS
systems it serves as the main application development environment and
provides consistent APIs into most other commonly used device functions.
Sailfish currently uses Qt version 5.2, but is working on updating the
stack to Qt 5.6.

The following modules are used within Sailfish OS:

  - QtCore
  - QtWebkit
  - QtDBus
  - QtGui
  - QtLocation
  - QtPositioning
  - QtMultimedia
  - QtNetwork
  - QtQuick
  - QtQml
  - QtSensors
  - QtSql
  - QtSvg
  - QtXml
  - QtXmlPatterns

There are many other Qt modules which are not used; most are obvious but
these are worth noting:

  - QtScript
  - QtOpengl
  - QtQuickWidgets
  - qtWidgets
