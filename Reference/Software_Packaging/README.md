## Software Packaging

Sailfish OS uses modern software packaging systems to allow controlled
over-the-air updates. A given device will be registered for a specific
variation of the operating system, where the variant specifies which
packages (and which versions of which packages) that device should have
access to.

### Device Variants

Each device variant is defined by a pattern file which describes the
initial filesystem content and packages to be installed in the device.
Device variants can be defined for different regions, different
operators, different device platforms, or any combination of those or
other variation inputs. Individual variants can have entirely different
content or packages defined, and the patterns are defined in such a way
to maximise reuse capability while minimising maintenance overhead,
while enforcing variant segregation at both image-creation and
device-update stages of the product lifecycle.

The variation system also allows for vendor-specific licenses, artwork,
and other content to be preinstalled on the devices they ship, via
package inclusion or via a secure filesystem partition.

Please see the documentation about [SSU](/Services/Deployment/SSU) and about the
[Store](/Services/Deployment/Store) for more information about the deployment
services for Sailfish OS and how updates are controlled for specific
variants.

### RPM

Sailfish OS uses RPM packages to handle native software distribution, [
which can be build using the SDK](/Develop/Platform/Building_packages).
PackageKit with libzypp backend are used as the middleware components to
handle the on-device RPM database. It supports binary diffing and
delta-rpm package upgrades to minimise bandwidth required for package
upgrades.

#### RPM packaging Guidelines

We are following quite closely Fedora's packaging guidelines, which you
can read from
<https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/>

##### Recent changes in Sailfish OS packaging

  - **URL** should point to our upstream git tree location for open
    source packages, e.g. <https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail>, to
    ensure that it is easy to find where the package is located, see
    more info of the current locations at
    [Sailfish OS\_Source\#Sailfish\_OS\_Source](/Services/Development/Sailfish_OS_Source)
  - For any license files one should have them marked with **%license**
    macro instead of **%doc** macro, more info at
    <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/LicensingGuidelines/>
  - Ensure that opensource license strings in **License:** match to
    shortnames at
    <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main#Software_License_List>
  - **Group:**, **Buildroot:** and **%clean** should not be used, see
    also
    <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#_tags_and_sections>
  - Use **%autosetup** instead of **%setup**
  - Packages having .desktop files don't need to anymore manually
    execute update-desktop-database in %post or %postun. It's now
    automatically handled by rpm file triggers.

##### Differences to Fedora guidelines

  - For [Building\_packages\#tar\_git\_packaging\_structure
    tar\_git](/Building_packages#tar_git_packaging_structure_tar_git)
    based packages the **Source:** line should be in format
    %{name}-%{version}.tar.bz2

### APK

Sailfish OS with Android App Support, can use applications in apk format
from Android. One core service provided by Sailfish OS is called apkd,
which mediates installation, deinstallation, upgrades and other
interaction with apk packages within Sailfish OS.

### Commands

[Sailfish OS Cheat
Sheet](/Sailfish_OS_Cheat_Sheet#Package_Handling) lists the
most common package handling commands.
