Sailfish OS can interact with several cloud services. The primary
Sailfish OS specific ones are:

  - [SSU](/Services/Deployment/SSU) : Seamless Software Update, an
    authentication/authorisation service that interacts with the Store
    to grant access to software downloads
  - [Store](/Services/Deployment/Store) : Application and software dowload
    service.
