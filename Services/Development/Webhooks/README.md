A [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) is a tool that
connects web services together to trigger behaviors when specific
actions are detected.

Sailfish OS development makes use of webhooks to automate the testing
and release of source code packages on the Mer [Open Build
Service](/Services/Development/Open_Build_Service) (OBS). There are webhooks
attached to the Sailfish OS source code repositories on the [Git
server](/Git_server) at <https://git.sailfishos.org>, and when
a new version of a source package in a repository is tagged released
through a git *tag*, the webhook notifies the Mer OBS, which then builds
a new version of the package based on the updated repository.

## Setting up webhooks for a Sailfish OS repository

Mer webhook services are located at
<https://webhook.merproject.org/webhook/>. To use this webhook to
connect a Git server with the Mer OBS and trigger automated builds, you
need to:

  - Add the Mer webhook to the git code repository
  - Allow the Mer OBS *cibot* service to access the repository to fetch
    packages

To add a webhook to a <https://git.sailfishos.org> code repository:

1.  Go to the package repository web page
2.  Click on "Settings"
3.  Click on "Web Hooks"
4.  Add <https://webhook.merproject.org/webhook/> as the URL
5.  Enable Tag push events

Then, give the Mer OBS cibot permissions to access the repository, by
adding the *cibot* user as a maintainer for the project. This can be
done via the OBS web interface:

1.  Go to the web page for the project (e.g.
    <https://build.merproject.org/package/show/mer-core:devel/ofono>)
2.  Click on the "Users" tab
3.  Click the "Add user" link (only available if you have the required
    project permissions)
4.  Enter *cibot* as the user and leave the role as "maintainer", and
    click the "Add user" button.

Make sure the package has a \_service file that lists the webhook
details. This should have been automatically generated by OBS when the
package was created. For example, the mer-core:devel ofono project has a
\_service file, as viewable at
<https://build.merproject.org/package/view_file/mer-core:devel/ofono/_service>.

Now that the webhook is set up, the Mer OBS should automatically trigger
a build for your project when a new tag is pushed to the remote git
repository.
